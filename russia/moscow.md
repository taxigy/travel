# Moscow

Despite common belief that Russian currency is cheap and
therefore stuff has to be cheap, it's far from truth. Moscow is
very expensive. It becomes especially clear after you see the
quality of services and goods there.

## Transport

Transport system is weak. Subway stations are so far from each
other, people literally consider proximity to them as top 1
priority when it comes to renting.

Subway system is "radiating" from the city center. Lines start in
center and go outwards. There's also one circular subway line.
Generally, it's not the most convenient way to move, as compared
to, for example, subway [in New York](../usa/new-york.md) or [in
Munic](../germany/munich.md).

Ãœber works just fine, however UberX is typically the lowest tier
cars that are quite old. Drivers are professional, but traffic is
a bit hard to predict, while driving speed varies significantly
depending on the area.

## B&B

Airbnb is full of scam. Just stay with greater than $100 per
night to see what you expect, be treated properly as a guest, and
not be asked to clean the whole apartment after you paid cleaning
free.

## Food

Local food is more expensive than almost anywhere in Europe, the
quality is good. Keep in mind that you can rarely tip a waiter
with credit card; cash is still the most preferred way.
