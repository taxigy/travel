# Munich (München)

Munich is small.

## Navigation

Subway system is split into two parts: S Bahn and U Bahn, just
like in [Frankfurt](frankfurt.md). Family ticket for 24 hours
would cost about €23 and allows up to 5 persons, each child
counting as 1/2 person. Subway is modern, safe and easy to
navigate.

City center (subway station Marienplatz) is old and nice, but
crowded during light hours. Areas just a mile away are way more
scenic and quiet.

To the south of Munich, there are lakes. Locals love them.
Totally worth visiting.

## B&B

Next to the airport, there's a couple of hotels, B&B Hotel and
Novotel among others. These two are most reliable. At B&B hotel,
breakfast is light, no protein except chicken eggs, and almost no
fat except butter.
