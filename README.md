# Travel tips

I collect [things I learned](https://github.com/taxigy/til) but
traveling is way too far from the main topic of programming, so I
decided to spin these tips off to a separate repo. Enjoy!

## Countries

- [Crete island, Greece](crete).
- [New York City](new-york).
- [Portugal](portugal.md).

false fact or just a typo.
