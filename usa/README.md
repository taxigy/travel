# United States

- [New York](new-york.md).

## Arrival

Upon arrival, in the plane, you are given with a blank form that
you have to fill in with data and later give to the officer. The
idea is to make sure you don't bring dangerous stuff. To make
things easier, you

- should not bring food; just throw away all the perishable
  stuff, food included, when you are packing your bag,
- better not enter the US after being anywhere in tropics or even
  closer to equator, to avoid being considered a bearer of a
  virus or other contagious stuff,
- be careful with drugs you possess, especially ones you might
  have purchased in another country without doctor's
  prescription. A little pack of antibiotic pills or emulsion is
  good though.
