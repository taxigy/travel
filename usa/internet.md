# Internet connection in the US

## Public Wi-Fi

It's easy to find a place with public Wi-Fi, however, most likely
you won't easily access the Wi-Fi hotspot there, because it will
be protected. There's no problem to ask staff for the password
though. Sometimes you don't even need to order anything, although
that would be expected, of course.

## Mobile

If you're going to stay short term (less than 3 months), it's
better to use prepaid plan. It will be more expensive, but that
also means you're not bound to a telecom company.

The easiest option is $50 prepaid SIM at T-Mobile, with 2 GB
monthly traffic. Technically, traffic is unlimited, but after you
have consumed it above threshold, the speed will be unbearably
slow (they claim 64 kbps, think of it!). The hack is simple: turn
off mobile internet for traffic burner apps like Instagram or
Google Photos, use only messengers, drive sharing, maps and such.

Every next month, you can add $50 to preserve your phone number,
otherwise just come by any T-Mobile store and buy one more SIM
card.

Mobile coverage is great within the city, unless you're under
ground. However, in the latter case, it's enough for you to track
subway stations, which assists well for your navigation.
